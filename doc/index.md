The Common Expression Language, CEL is an embedded expression language tailored
to simple computations on protocol buffers. CEL is not used standalone but
rather embedded in an application context, with application specific extensions.
List filters for API calls, validation constraints on protocol buffers
(go/protocontracts), and authorization rules for API requests (go/verax) are
examples of CEL applications.

This site contains an introduction to the core language, its definition, and
information how to embed the parser and type checker into applications. For
application-specific information about how CEL is applied and extended consult
the application documentation.
